Apple’s cash balances increased by $2.8bn in the last three months alone.Apple sold 48m iPhones worth $33.2bn in its latest quarter – an increase of 36% on the same period last year and more than the total sales achieved by both Microsoft and Facebook over the same period.Its quarterly profit came in at $11.1bn, 31% more than in the fourth quarter of 2014. Sales were up 22% in the three months to 28 September to $51.5bn.Not an Apple Music subscriber?

The average iPhone now sells for $670, an increase of $67 on the previous quarter. Sales in China doubled compared to the same period last year, to $12.5bn, and some analysts predict that China could overtake the US to become Apple’s biggest market. While the iPhone continues to soar, iPad sales dropped for the seventh consecutive quarter and were down 20% compared to the 2014 fourth quarter. The company did not state how many Apple Watches it has sold. Apple’s shares, which have fallen by about 15% from a peak of $133 in July, increased by 0.6% to $114.5o in after-hours trading in New York on Tuesday. This article was amended on 28 October 2015 because an earlier version said Apple sold 48bn iPhones in its latest quarter. This has been corrected to say 48m iPhones.
